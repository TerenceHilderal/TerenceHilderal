♾️ Devops Engineer ♾️

 A former maintenance technician with a passion for technology. For 8 years, I've always loved poking around, taking things apart, fixing things and understanding how things work. 

I'm a technology fanatic, so I recently retrained as a JavaScript developer. I've just shifted my curiosity from maintenance to web technologies 👀

 Currently training to become a DevOps engineer, my technical skills include, among other things: 
- Automation of infrastructure deployment and management. 
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines for continuous and reliable deployment.
- Container management with Docker and Kubernetes.

 In addition to my technical skills, I'm someone who likes to help others, learn continuously and find solutions to problems.

 I'm not looking for a job at the moment, but we can always keep in touch. If you've come across my profile, it's because we'll probably need each other one day, and you'll understand that I'll be more than happy to help. Speaking of which, I'm mobile throughout France and abroad.
